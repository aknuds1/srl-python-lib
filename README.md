With the SRL Python Library we intend to consolidate bits and pieces which are
used in Python projects at the Simula Research Laboratory (SRL), and share
them as a public library. It functions mostly as a supplement to the standard
library, with for instance higher-level alternatives to filesystem
manipulation functions in the standard modules os and shutil.

The convenience functions/structures contained in this library have evolved
out of practical experience in cross-platform (mostly Linux, Windows)
applications development. It is a priority to us that the code is cross-
platform safe.
